  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nStop stalling, make a name for yourself\nBoy, you better put that pen to paper and charm your way out\nIf you talk, you better walk, you better back your shit up\nWith more than good hooks while you're all under the gun\nStart talking \"a sensationalist\"\nOh, he's slightly clever, to just a certain extent\nIf you talk, you better walk, you better keep your mouth shut\nWith more than good hooks while you're all under the gun\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nPanic!, meet the press\nIt's time for us to take a chance\nIt's time for us to take a chance\nPanic!, meet the press\nIt's time for us to take a chance\nIt's time for us\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, we're just a wet dream for the webzine\nMake us it, make us hip, make us scene\nOr shrug us off your shoulders\nDon't approve a single word that we wrote\nWell, we're just a wet dream for the webzine\nMake us it, make us hip, make us scene\nOr shrug us off your shoulders\nDon't approve a single word that we wrote\n\n\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm burning, and I'm blacking my lungs\nBoy, you know it feels good with fire back on your tongue\nIf you talk, you better walk, you better back your shit up\nWith more than good hooks while you're all under the gun\nStart talking \"a sensationalist\"\nOh, he's slightly clever, to just a certain extent\nWell, keep quiet! Let us sing like the doves\nThen decide if it's done with purpose or lack thereof\n\n[Interlude]\nJust for the record, the weather today\nIs slightly sarcastic with a good chance of\nA: indifference, or B: disinterest\nIn what the critics say\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's time for us to take a chance\nIt's time for us\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, we're just a wet dream for the webzine\nMake us it, make us hip, make us scene\nOr shrug us off your shoulders\nDon't approve a single word that we wrote\nWell, we're just a wet dream for the webzine\nMake us it, make us hip, make us scene\nOr shrug us off your shoulders\nDon't approve a single word that we wrote\n\n\n\n\n[Bridge]\n(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la)\n(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)\n(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la)\n(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)\nJust for the record, the weather today\nIs slightly sarcastic with a good chance of\n(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la)\n(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)\nA: indifference, or B: disinterest\nIn what the critics say\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, we're just a wet dream for the webzine\nMake us it, make us hip, make us scene\nOr shrug us off your shoulders\nDon't approve a single word that we wrote\nWell, we're just a wet dream for the webzine\nMake us it, make us hip, make us scene\nOr shrug us off your shoulders\nDon't approve a single word that we wrote\n\n[Outro]\nJust for the record, the weather today\nIs slightly sarcastic with a good chance of\nA: indifference, or B: disinterest\nIn what the critics say",
