  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWell, she's not bleeding\nOn the ballroom floor just for the attention\n'Cause that's just ridiculous...ly odd\nWell, she sure is gonna get it\nHere's the setting: fashion magazines line the walls\nNow, the walls line the bullet holes\n\n[Chorus]\nHave some composure, and where is your posture? (Oh, no, no!)\nYou're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger (All wrong)\nHave some composure, and where is your posture? (Oh, no, no!)\nYou're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger (All wrong)\n\n[Refrain]\nGive me envy, give me malice, give me your attention\nGive me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break!\nWhen I say, \"Shotgun,\" you say, \"Wedding\"\nShotgun wedding! Shotgun wedding!\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe didn't choose this role\nBut she'll play it and make it sincere so\nYou cry, you cry (Give me a break)\nBut they believe it from the tears and the teeth\nRight down to the blood at her feet\nBoys will be boys, hiding in estrogen\nAnd wearing Aubergine Dreams (Give me a break)\n\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\nHave some composure, and where is your posture? (Oh, no, no!)\nYou're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger (All wrong)\nHave some composure, and where is your posture? (Oh, no, no!)\nYou're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger (All wrong)\n\n[Bridge]\nCome on, this is screaming \"photo op,\" op, come on, come on\nThis is screaming, this is screaming, this is screaming \"photo op\"\nBoys will be boys, baby, boys will be boys\nBoys will be boys, baby, boys will be boys\n\n[Refrain]\nGive me envy, give me malice, give me your attention\nGive me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break!\nWhen I say, \"Shotgun,\" you say, \"Wedding\"\nShotgun wedding! Shotgun wedding!\n\n[Outro]\nBoys will be boys, hiding in estrogen\nAnd boys will be boys\nBoys will be boys, hiding in estrogen\nAnd wearing Aubergine Dreams",
