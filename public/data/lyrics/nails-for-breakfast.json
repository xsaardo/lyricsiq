Oh no, he called in\nOr was it God who chokes in these situations\nRunning late? Oh no, he called in\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe hospice is\nA relaxing weekend getaway where you're a cut above all the rest\nSick and sad patients on first name basis\nWith all the top physicians\n\n[Chorus]\nPrescribed pills\nTo offset the shakes, to offset the pills\nYou know you should\nTake it a day at a time\n\n[Verse 2]\nThat's when you st-st-stutter something profound\nTo the support on the line\nAnd with the way you've been talking\nEvery word gets you a step closer to hell\nThat's when you st-st-stutter something profound\nTo the support on the line\nAnd with the way you've been talking\nEvery word gets you a step closer to hell\n\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\nPrescribed pills\nTo offset the shakes, to offset the pills\nYou know you should\nTake it a day at a time\nPrescribed pills\nTo offset the shakes, to offset the pills\nYou know you should\nTake it a day at a time\n\n[Bridge]\nI am\nAlone in this bed, house, and head\nAnd she never fixes this\nBut at least she\nI am\nAlone in this bed, ooh\nShe never fixes this\nBut at least she\n\n[Chorus]\nPrescribed pills\nTo offset the shakes, to offset the pills\nYou know you should\nTake it a day at a time\nPrescribed pills\nTo offset the shakes, to offset the pills\nYou know you should\nTake it a day at a time\n\n\n\n\n[Outro]\nThe hospice is\nA relaxing weekend getaway where you're a cut above all the rest\nSick and sad patients on first name basis\nWith all the top physicians",
