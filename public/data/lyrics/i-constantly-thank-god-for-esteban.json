  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nGive us this day our daily dose of faux affliction\nForgive our sins, forged at the pulpit\nWith forked tongues selling faux sermons\nBecause I am a new-wave gospel sharp, and you'll be thy witness\nSo, gentlemen, if you're gonna preach\nFor God sakes, preach with conviction!\n\n[Chorus]\nStrike up the band! Whoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning\nCome, congregation, let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it? Don't you get it? Now, don't you move\nStrike up the band! Whoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning\nCome, congregation, let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it? Don't you get it? Now, don't you move\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nJust stay where I can see you, douse the lights!\n...We sure are in for a show tonight!\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn this little number, we're graced by two displays of character\nWe've got the gunslinger extraordinaire, a walking contradiction\nAnd I, for one, can see no blood\nFrom the hearts and the wrists you allegedly slit\nAnd I, for one, won't stand for this\nIf this scene were a parish, you'd all be condemned\n\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\nStrike up the band! Whoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning\nCome, congregation, let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it? Don't you get it? Now, don't you move\nStrike up the band! Whoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning\nCome, congregation, let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it? Don't you get it? Now, don't you move\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nJust stay where I can see you, douse the lights\n...We sure are in for a show tonight!\nJust stay where I can see you, douse the lights!\n...We sure are in for a show tonight!\nStay where I can see you, douse the lights!\n\n[Chorus]\nStrike up the band! Whoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning\nCome, congregation, let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it? Don't you get it? Now, don't you move\nStrike up the band! Whoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning\nCome, congregation, let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it? Don't you get it? Now, don't you move\nDon't you move, don't you move... strike up the band!",
